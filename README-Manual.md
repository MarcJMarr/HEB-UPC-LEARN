# HEB-UPC-LEARN
This program is designed  to help CSA's memorize 30 of the most common produce codes for when they get on the register. This is made publicly for anyone at any HEB who would like to use it. It is a simple program to run but in order to do so you do need to have python installed. This was made using python version 3.12

Heres a link to the official website to install python ----> https://www.python.org/

To install python:
1) go to the website
2) Click on the "downloads" tab
3) Click "Download Python #.##.#"
4) Once the exe file is downloaded click on the file
5) When the program runs, click on the first option to install
6) wait for it to finish
7) done! 

Prompts in this Program: 

There are 5 different sets to choose from, if you are new and don't know any codes I would strongly recommend you start with set 1. 

The 30 (well actually 29) codes are splitup into different groups to make learning them less challenging. 

In this program some of the prompts might not make sense so I will explain them here. 


**Prompt: "Hpw many times would you like to input a code correctly"**
When the program asks you "How many times would you like to input a code correctly" Its asking you if you would like to enter the correct answer multiple times. 
An example:  Lets say I set it to three and get the item Garlic. I would have to type the code for garlic and hit enter three separate times. This is for people who would like repitition.


**Prompt: "How many codes do you want to attempt"**
When the program asks you "how many codes do you want to attempt" its asking you how many codes would you like to be given. If I put 100 I would need to answer 100 codes correctly. If I put 50 I would need to answer 50 codes correctly and etc.

**Prompt: "Do you want to learn more?"**
When the program asks you if you want to learn more, its asking if you would like to learn the same set or a different set (you would type y then) or if you want to exit the program (you would type n)
